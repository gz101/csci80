# CSCI 80: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

My own solutions to the Harvard Extension School's CSCI 80 course. These solutions are only a record of my self-directed study on this course and are not to be used by students taking the course.

All content is from the Fall 2023 version of this course and the website can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/extension/ai/2023/fall/).
